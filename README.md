# OpenTF Roadmap

### Now that [OpenTF](github.com/opentffoundation/opentf) is available, the project's roadmap has moved there, and will be managed via GitHub [issues](https://github.com/opentffoundation/opentf/issues) and [milestones](https://github.com/opentffoundation/opentf/milestones) on that repo 🚀

~This repository is intended to publicly capture the important items on the OpenTF roadmap, including milestones, like public availability of OpenTF, and what they're blocked by.~

~You are welcome to comment on the issues here or create your own. Once the OpenTF repository is public, these issues will be moved there.~

~To learn more, please see the [OpenTF Manifesto](https://opentf.org) and check out its [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/opentffoundation/manifesto).~
